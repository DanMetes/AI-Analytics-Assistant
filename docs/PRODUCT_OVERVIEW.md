# Analyst Agent — Product Overview

Analyst Agent is an analytic application that transforms raw tabular datasets into structured insights, diagnostic findings, and explainable interpretations.

The system is built around:
- Deterministic analysis as the system of record
- Artifact-first outputs
- Optional LLM-based interpretation and exploration
- Centralized execution for scalability and monetization

The core product is a reproducible analytic job whose outputs can be inspected, explained, and extended.
